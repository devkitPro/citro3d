# citro3d

citro3d is a library that provides an easy to use stateful interface to the PICA200 GPU of the Nintendo 3DS. It tries to expose hardware functionality in the way that is most natural and convenient to the GPU and the user, therefore deviating from openGL.

# Setup

citro3d can be built and installed using the following command:

    make install
